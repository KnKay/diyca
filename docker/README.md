# DIYCA Docker

As raspberry pi is capable of docker I had the idea running diyca in a container. 

The install was not as easy as I had it in mind. To keep the trouble form any one in future I will write a small docker part for this project. 

## Issues
* Docker had no rsyslog installed. Due to this we need to install this piece of software. 
* Some pip3 stuff was not goig fine
